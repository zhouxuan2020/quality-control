[["good-vs-bad-gwas.html", "3 Good VS Bad GWAS 3.1 constant inflation?", " 3 Good VS Bad GWAS Here we investigate the inflation in test statistics from the bad GWASs. We want to find out 1) if the inflation is constant; 2) if it can be predicted in some way. 3.1 constant inflation? The inflation in test statistics does not seem to be constant. We plotted the chi-square test statistic from the bad GWASs against those from the good GWASs. If the inflation is constant, we would expect all points deviate from the diagonal line to a similar extent. However, this is not evident ( See Fig 3.1 for bmi and neur). Interestingly, instead of being inflated, some test statistics shrink relative to those in the good GWASs. This observation implies that the constant inflation in GWAS statistics assumed by the underlying model of ldsc regression is incorrect. Figure 3.1: Test statistics of bad and good GWASs "]]
