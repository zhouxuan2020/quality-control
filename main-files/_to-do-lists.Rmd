# To do list

1. Is it sufficient to use SNPs from two chromosomes?
2. ldak-thin snps only?
3. check the LD(or sum_r_ij^2) of the SNPs with low LD in the original ldsc analysis.
 Correlate the LD score from ldsc with the cross-chromosome LD score

4. write down equations for revised ldsc
use average LD x m1*m2

5. compute LD scores using individual level data.
